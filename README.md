# Bash/Python exercise

This exercise is composed of two Python scripts—one that reads text files with lists of items and one that writes sorted results to text files—and one bash script that ties the two Python modules together. When executing the bash script and adding the name of a text file as an argument—for example, `./builder.sh videogames`—the program will compile an alphabetically sorted and numbered list of items in a separate text file.
