# Bash/Python exercise

This exercise is composed of two Python scripts—one that reads text files and one that writes results to text files—and one bash script that ties the two Python modules together. When executing the bash script and adding the name of a text file as an argument—for example, `./builder.sh videogames`—the program will compile an alphabetically sorted and numbered list of items in the text file.
