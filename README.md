# Bash/Python exercise

This exercise is composed of two python scripts--one that reads text files and one that writes results to text files--and on bash script that ties the two Python modules together. When executing the bash script and adding the name of a text file as an argument--`./builder.sh videogames`--the program will compile an alphabetically sorted and numbered list of items in the text file.
